# DataBaseTori

## Intro

This project contains scripts for an online database designed to track second-hand finances. The system utilizes the SQLite library to create the database and the socket library to host a server and enable client communication.

## State

The foundational components of the server-client architecture and the database have been completed, and the system has been tested to work locally. The next step is to implement a login procedure on the server and test client communication over the internet.

## Aim

- Practice using SQLite and socket libraries.
- Familiarize myself with web programming.
- Practice writing test functions
- Establish a functional database to track second-hand sales.
